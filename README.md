# About carsnic

**Carsnic** is a security system for parkings, based on rpitx from https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx. The program is triggered by a camera which detects the actions of theftery.
It generates a signal mirrored to the initial one in order to neutralize this effect. This is useful to prevent strangers from unlocking your car.
